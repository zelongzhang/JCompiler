To run the J-- reference compiler:

% cd reference
% ./main -h				(for options)

Use the reference compiler's command-line options to stop and see its
output at earlier stages.  At present the scanner, parser, semantic
checker, and MIPS code generator output are available.  The generated
MIPS code omits the run-time system.

% ./main -ptokenize testfile		(for scanner output)

The scanner output is a list of tokens.  Each token is a triple
(token type as string, line number as integer, token lexeme as string).
Note that the EOF is implicit in the list ending, so there's no
explicit EOF token being produced here.

% ./main -pparse testfile		(for parser AST output)

The parser output is a textual representation of the AST.

% ./main -psemantic testfile		(for semantic checker's AST output)

The semantic checker's output is a textual representation of the AST
that is decorated with more information.

% ./main -pirgen testfile		(for IR code)

This is for curiosity only, since ***YOU DO NOT NEED TO GENERATE ANY
INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION***.
